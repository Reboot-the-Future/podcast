# Episode Description Formatting Guide

Your episode descriptions now support **Markdown formatting**! This allows you to easily add bold text, italic text, links, and line breaks directly in the admin panel.

## How to Use Markdown in Episode Descriptions

### 1. **Bold Text**
To make text bold, wrap it with double asterisks:

```
**This text will be bold**
```

**Example:**
```
Listen as we explore **artificial intelligence** and its impact on society.
```

### 2. *Italic Text*
To make text italic, wrap it with single asterisks:

```
*This text will be italic*
```

**Example:**
```
Join us for an *amazing* conversation about the future.
```

### 3. Links
To create a clickable link, use this format:

```
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

**Example:**
```
Visit [Reboot the Future](https://rebootthefuture.org) to learn more.
```

### 4. Line Breaks & Paragraphs
To add spacing in your descriptions:

**Single Line Break:**
End a line with two spaces, then press Enter:
```
First line  
Second line (with single line break)
```

**New Paragraph:**
Press Enter twice (leave a blank line between paragraphs):
```
First paragraph.

Second paragraph (with more spacing).
```

## Complete Example

Here's how you might write a full episode description:

```
Join us for a **groundbreaking conversation** with Dr. Jane Smith about the future of technology.

We explore *how AI is reshaping our world* and what it means for the next generation.

Learn more at [Reboot the Future](https://rebootthefuture.org) or check out our [research page](https://rebootthefuture.org/research).
```

This will display as:

> Join us for a **groundbreaking conversation** with Dr. Jane Smith about the future of technology.
> 
> We explore *how AI is reshaping our world* and what it means for the next generation.
> 
> Learn more at [Reboot the Future](https://rebootthefuture.org) or check out our [research page](https://rebootthefuture.org/research).

## Need Help?

If you need to include literal asterisks without formatting, you can escape them with a backslash:
```
\*This will not be italic\*
```
